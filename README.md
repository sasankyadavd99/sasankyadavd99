### About Me ✌️

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Applied Machine Intelligence at Northeastern University, from Spring 2023. My data science expertise fuels innovation in predictive analytics across sectors, focusing on AI in healthcare. At Cloudport AI, I refine predictive models to better BFSI healthcare decision-making. My passion lies in harnessing machine learning to transform data into strategic insights.

Before my Master’s, I sharpened my Data Science foundation at TCS and IBM, optimizing data systems and advancing machine learning models. My industry savvy is backed by a strong academic record from GITAM in Computer Science.

My approach to data science is holistic; I delve into complex data challenges by scraping data from various web sources, ensuring thorough data cleaning to maintain integrity. I employ a range of visualization techniques, from intricate heatmaps that reveal hidden patterns to dynamic line graphs that track trends over time, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying data. Through these methods, alongside rigorous statistical analysis, I lay the groundwork for ML models that are not only predictive but also prescriptive, capable of driving substantial cost reductions and averting potential system outages.

Eager to broaden my knowledge further, I'm currently exploring the vast potential of cloud technologies and deep learning. My goal is to spearhead the next frontier of data science innovation, equipped with advanced techniques such as Random Forest and XGBoost, and a keen eye for the impactful application of data visualizations and statistical principles in machine learning.
